George Brown College was founded in 1967 by merging two trade institutes, though additional buildings had
already been constructed in Kensington Market between 1952-1957 to meet space needs. The college officially
opened in 1968 with 2,000 students and has since grown to around 30,000 full-time students. Over the years,
it has expanded significantly, doubling in size since 2004 and forming international partnerships.
