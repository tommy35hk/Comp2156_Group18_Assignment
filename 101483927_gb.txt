George Brown College was founded in 1967 by merging two trade institutes, though additional buildings had
already been constructed in Kensington Market between 1952-1957 to meet space needs. The college officially
opened in 1968 with 2,000 students and has since grown to around 30,000 full-time students. Over the years,
it has expanded significantly, doubling in size since 2004 and forming international partnerships.

The Casa Loma Campus opened in 1973, offering programs in construction, IT, jewellery making, and dance.

In 1986, a child care centre was established at Waterpark Place for Early Childhood Education training. In 
2003, George Brown became one of the first Ontario colleges to offer bachelor's degrees.

Further advancements included the launch of the BIM Lab in 2014 and the Brookfield Sustainability Institute 
in 2023 to support climate action.
