SDLC stands for software development life cycle. A DevOps engineer traverses the gap between developer and 
operation team members with SDLC strategies. It typically has six stages: requirement analysis, design, 
development and testing, implementation, documentation, and evaluation. SDLC approaches range from agile to 
iterative to sequential.

Agile methods like Scrum allow for fast changes with lightweight processes.

A project may include both a project life cycle and an SDLC, each with different tasks. SDLC is not a 
methodology but a set of phases that methodologies follow. The waterfall model, the oldest SDLC approach, 
follows a step-by-step process. Other SDLC methods include spiral, agile, rapid prototyping, incremental, 
and synchronize and stabilize. SDLC consists of structured work phases used by engineers and developers to 
build systems. In Scrum, a user story goes through all SDLC phases within a two-week sprint.
