SDLC stands for software development life cycle. A DevOps engineer traverses the gap between developer and 
operation team members with SDLC strategies. It typically has six stages: requirement analysis, design, 
development and testing, implementation, documentation, and evaluation. SDLC approaches range from agile to 
iterative to sequential.

Agile methods like Scrum allow for fast changes with lightweight processes.
