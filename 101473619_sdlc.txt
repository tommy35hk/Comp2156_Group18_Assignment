DevOps combines development (Dev) and operations (Ops) to increase the efficiency, speed, 
and security of software development and delivery compared to traditional processes. 
DevOps enhances the speed and efficiency of software development, testing, and deployment by 
implementing continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD). Companies can swiftly and 
consistently release software updates to meet the ever-growing user demands by employing 
the' Automate Everything' mindset of DevOps.

By adopting DevOps practices, the development processes become aligned and speedier, resulting 
in a more flexible execution of the software. DevOps emphasizes the importance of collaboration, 
automation, and continuous improvement, allowing software teams to deliver high-quality software 
faster and more efficiently.
 
Problems DevOps can solve
Before DevOps, during the SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)  the development teams used to 
face a few common problems. These were underestimating the time required for testing the software 
for bug detection, leveraging the waterfall model that resulted in causing delays in the software 
release, or a low-quality software that was not meeting expectations.

The problem with the traditional or waterfall way of software development was that it used to 
work in a methodical way where the new phase began after the finalization of the previous phase. 
Everything would need to start from square one if any bug was detected later. Ultimately, the 
waterfall method was often blamed e for delays in software development since it failed to prove 
its worth in the SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle).

In comparison to the waterfall way of software development, DevOps implements two simple rules; 
one is a shorter product development cycle and the other one is the automation of the deployment 
pipeline. Apart from them, it can reduce the percentage of errors as it goes through the 
continuous software testing process. 

Hence over time, DevOps has been proven to be more effective than traditional software development 
methods.
