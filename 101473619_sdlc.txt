What Is DevOps?
DevOps is a term for a group of concepts that, while not all new, catalyzed into a movement 
in 2009 and rapidly spread throughout the technical community.  Like any popular term, people 
often have confused and contradictory impressions of what it means.  Here’s my take on how 
DevOps can be usefully defined; I propose this definition as a standard framework to more 
clearly discuss the various areas DevOps covers. Like “Quality” or “Agile,” DevOps is a large 
enough concept that it requires some nuance to fully understand.

Definition of DevOps
DevOps emerged from the collision of two major related trends. The first was called “agile 
infrastructure” or “agile operations”; it sprang from applying Agile and Lean approaches to 
operations work.  The second is an expanded understanding of the value of collaboration between 
development and operations staff throughout all stages of the development lifecycle when 
creating and operating a service, and how important operations has become in our increasingly 
service-oriented world (cf. Operations: The New Secret Sauce).
