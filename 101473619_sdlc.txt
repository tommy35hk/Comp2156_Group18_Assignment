DevOps combines development (Dev) and operations (Ops) to increase the efficiency, speed, and security of software development and delivery compared to traditional processes. 
DevOps enhances the speed and efficiency of software development, testing, and deployment by implementing continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD). Companies can swiftly 
and consistently release software updates to meet the ever-growing user demands by employing the' Automate Everything' mindset of DevOps.
