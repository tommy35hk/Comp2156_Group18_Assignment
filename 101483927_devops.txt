DevOps combines software development and IT operations to speed up application delivery by uniting teams and
reducing redundancies. It fosters collaboration in fast-paced environments, enabling continuous integration,
where developers frequently save code to a shared repository, and continuous delivery, allowing quick and 
reliable software updates.

GitHub, an open-source platform, helps programmers store, share, and collaborate on code like a social 
network.

Version control systems track and manage code changes, while distributed version control lets each user 
maintain their own repository.
