### What is SDLC? ###
The software development lifecycle (SDLC) is the cost-effective and time-efficient process that development teams use to design and build high-quality software. 
The goal of SDLC is to minimize project risks through forward planning so that software meets customer expectations during production and beyond.

### Why is SDLC important? ###
Software development can be challenging to manage due to changing requirements, technology upgrades, and cross-functional collaboration. The software development lifecycle (SDLC)
methodology provides a systematic management framework with specific deliverables at every stage of the software development process.

Benefits of SDLC:
- Increased visibility of the development process for all stakeholders involved
- Efficient estimation, planning, and scheduling
- Improved risk management and cost estimation
- Systematic software delivery and better customer satisfaction

Stage 1: Project Planning
Stage 2: Gathering Requirements & Analysis
Stage 3: Design
Stage 4: Coding or Implementation
